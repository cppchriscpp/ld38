# Missing Lands

This is the code behind a little game called Missing Lands. It was built in 48 hours for Ludum Dare.

Check it out on [the Ludum Dare Website](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/missing-lands)

Or [play it](http://cpprograms.net/classic-gaming/missing-lands/) on my site.

Better yet, [download the rom](http://cpprograms.net/devnull/world.nes) and play it yourself. The web-based emulator
has its issues... many of them.

NOTE: There is some stuff missing from my source - it looks like I accidentally saved some famitracker files in the
wrong spot. The txt/nsf exports are there, so you can build it just fine; you just can't edit the music.
I'll get that sorted soon. Will get this properly documented and sorted out once I get some rest.

## Building

Run `make` in the root directory and hope for the best! You'll need cc65 in the tools folder, nodejs installed, and
maybe a few more things. (I'll fill this out when I have had rest!)
